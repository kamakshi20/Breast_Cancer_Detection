One of the most prevalent diseases in both males and women is breast cancer. Breast cells begin to grow improperly, which is how breast cancer develops. Numerous people pass away each year as a result of this disease. It is the most prevalent form of cancer and the leading killer of women globally.

Data classification techniques such as data mining are very successful today. Particularly when discussing the medical field, where we use machine learning to identify diseases and conduct analyses in order to reach specific choices.

So with the help of Machine learning if we can classify the patient having which type of cancer, then it will be easy for doctors to provide timely treatment to patients and improve the chance of survival.
